To create manuscript figures and tables:

1. Knit `prediction/generate_prediction_data.Rmd`
2. Knit `generate_manuscript_artefacts.Rmd`

The resulting figures and tables are saved in the `figures` directory.
This is sub-divided into a `main` and `supplment` directory. Note that
the generated tables are embedded in `tables.docx`
