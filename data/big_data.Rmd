AIM: Compile all the age and sex disaggregated TB data for years 2012 to 2020. All countries included. 

STEP 1: Set working directory and load the data 

```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop/AFP/modV3/data")
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("TB_notifications.csv")
data_tb <- data[, c(1,3,5,6,71:73, 82:84, 100:104, 113,115:119, 128,171,173,175,194)]
big_data <- filter(data_tb, year > 2012)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
